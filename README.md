#### Things Learned:

1. Working with React state management (useState, useEffect).
2. Utilizing local storage for persistent data.
3. Implementing drag and drop functionality in React.

#### Most Difficult Part:

The most challenging aspect of this assignment was implementing the drag and drop functionality to move events between dates horizontally. It required managing complex state interactions and updating the UI dynamically.

#### What Could Be Done Differently:

Given more time, I would improve the user interface and add more polished animations to enhance the overall user experience. If more time is provided, I would also implement the timeline feature to enhance the calendar's functionality and usability.
